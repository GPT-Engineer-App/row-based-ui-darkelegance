# row-based-ui-darkelegance

I have a postgres SQL database. I want to present the data to my client. For now let's focus on the layout and UI instead of fetching the data. Use dummy data for now. I want to have a row based UI. Use alternating colours for every second row. Present the UI in DarkMode. The row based UI needs to white. Use white and creme white for the alternating color shift. Do 5 columns for now.
